Description: pysam - a python module for reading, manipulating and writing
        genomic data sets.
        
        pysam is a lightweight wrapper of the htslib C-API and provides
        facilities to read and write SAM/BAM/VCF/BCF/BED/GFF/GTF/FASTA/FASTQ
        files as well as access to the command line functionality of the
        samtools and bcftools packages. The module supports compression and
        random access through indexing.
        
        This module provides a low-level wrapper around the htslib C-API as
        using cython and a high-level API for convenient access to the data
        within standard genomic file formats.
        
        The current version wraps htslib-1.3.1, samtools-1.3.1 and bcftools-1.3.1.
